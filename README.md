#THE HEARTUNERRING
This project consists of a ML model in a fully responsive web page that predicts heart disease and correlated complications, a proper graphical analysis along with preventive measures and diet solutions.

##DESCRIPTION
Development in Health Sector and Disease prediction Models are in high demand.Our Prediction Model takes various inputs from users and predicts not only the disease but also gives a personalized diet solution. So our model 'The heartunerring' gives a approach to solve the heart related errors to help people achieve a healthy heart.let's discuss in detail:
1.User-dashboard page:
The user dashboard takes various inputs like
 -Age
 -Gender
 -Having Chest pain or not?
 -Resting Blood pressure
 -Serum cholestrol
 -Fasting Blood Sugar
 -Ecg
 -Miniumum Heart rate
 -Exercise induced Angina
2.Regression Models:
3.Disease prediction System: The user inputs taken, and the model is trained to predict the heart related diseases and complications.
4.Graphical Diet solutions:
