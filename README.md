# THE HEARTUNERRING

This project consists of a ML model in a fully responsive web page that predicts heart disease and correlated complications, a proper graphical analysis along with preventive measures and diet solutions.

## DESCRIPTION

*Development in Health Sector and Disease prediction Models are in high demand.<br>
Our Prediction Model takes various inputs from users and predicts not only the disease but also gives a personalized diet solution.<br>
So our model 'The heartunerring' gives a approach to solve the heart related errors to help people achieve a healthy heart.let's discuss in detail:<br>*
1. **User-dashboard page:**
The user dashboard takes various inputs like
- Age
- Gender
- Having Chest pain or not?
- Resting Blood pressure
- Serum cholestrol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Ecg
- Miniumum Heart rate
- Exercise induced Angina
2. **Regression Models:**
3. **Disease prediction System:** The user inputs taken, and the model is trained to predict the heart related diseases and complications.
4. **Graphical Diet solutions:** The<br>
